    <h2>Find Out the Meaning Behind Your Birthstone</h2>
    <p>
      This tradition of the birthstone goes back to the <em>Book of Exodus</em>,
      in which the first high priest of the Israelites wore a breastplate with
      twelve stones, believed to have magical powers, representing the twelve
      tribes of Israel. It became a tradition for Christians to wear all twelve
      stones, recalling the breastplate. As time went on, people started
      rotating through their collection and wearing one stone on its own, based
      on which one was believed to have heightened powers at that time. This
      eventually evolved to associating particular gemstones with birth months.
      <br /><br />
      Birthstones are a fun, popular and colorful introduction to the world of
      gemstones. They appeal to audiences around the world regardless of gender,
      age, nationality or religion. Birthstones carry secrets, attributes and
      lore that are unique to each gemstone. There are countless myths and
      legends around the many different powers and attributes that birthstones
      have. Whether or not you believe these legends, it‚Äôs hard to disagree that
      learning about birthstones can be an educational and entertaining
      experience.<br /><br /><span class="bold">

Few things catch the eye like the ruby birthstone. The finest color of the birthstone for July is a deep red with a hint of purple, called ‚Äúpigeon‚Äôs blood‚Äù in the trade. A variety of the mineral corundum, ruby gets its color from trace amounts of the element chromium. The more chromium, the stronger the red. <a href="https://www.gia.edu/birthstones/july-birthstones" target="blank">Read more</a> or choose a different month below ‚á£`
